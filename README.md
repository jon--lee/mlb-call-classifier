# mlb-call-classifier
Umpire's aren't perfect. It's impossible to call pitches correctly
100 percent of the time. At a lot of pitches end up on the corners and edges
of the strike zone. But can we find patterns in umpires' calls?
Do some umpires tend to call low pitches strikes and high pitches balls?
This classifier uses neuralpy and MLB GameDay Data to develop a graphical representation of how 
an umpire sees his or her *unique strikezone.*
